# 2 in 1 Programmer
> This project is actually a combination of 2 projects. I needed a _1Wire programmer_ and also an _EEPROM parallel programmer_. Since I had to use an _Arduino Mega_ board, I had plenty of space and `GPIO` to integrate both in one place :wink:.

You can contact me at [github](https://github.com/monjazeb) or by this [email](mailto:armonj@gmail.com).
